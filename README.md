# MLB Starting Pitchers and Starting Rotations Analysis
Analysis of MLB starting pitchers and MLB teams' starting pitching rotations from the 2010 season through the 2019 season (min. 100 innings pitched over this time period for a 
pitcher to be included).

The goal of this project was to analyze starting pitchers in the MLB first by their pitching style rather than their level of success. Then, to continue the anlysis by examining 
different compositions of MLB starting pitching rotations based on the different pitching styles of the pitchers that make them up, and to see which rotation compostions have lead 
to the most success over the past ten seasons. The examination of different starting pitching styles was accomplished through k-means clustering.

All data for this project was taken from Fangraphs (https://www.fangraphs.com/) and Baseball Reference (https://www.baseball-reference.com/).
